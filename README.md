# Todo-list-app-using-EJS-and-Express

## Welcome to our EJS To-Do List App! This app is a simple and easy-to-use to-do list application built using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) and Node.js.<br>

Getting started with the app is easy. First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. Then, clone or download the repository from GitHub and navigate to the root directory in your terminal.<br>

Next, run the command "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app by running the command "npm start" and the app will be available at "http://localhost:3000" in your browser.<br>


The app also uses EJS to render the views, allowing you to easily customize the layout and design of the app to suit your needs.<br>

We hope you find this app useful and we welcome any feedback or suggestions. Please feel free to submit any issues or pull requests on the GitHub repository.
